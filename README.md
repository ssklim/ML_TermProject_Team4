 book recommendation system

## The objective of the system

There are lots of researches about why people have to read books. It can contribute to language development / ability to think / emotional and intellectual development.

But nowadays, it is rare to find people reading books. Instead of reading books, people prefer watching video contents like movies or dramas. So what we are trying to do is to analyze people’s personal taste by using the movies / movie ratings dataset, and recommend similar books for them.

We hope that this recommendation system can be a first step to make people read more books.
